#### **FICHE DE RÉVISION - VOCABULARY & GRAMMAR**

**🎯 Key Sentences to Remember**
*   To say what you saw: **"I saw..."** + a thing / people + verb-ing.
*   To say what you didn't see: **"I didn't see..."** or **"I did not see..."**
*   Use **"a"** before singular words (a boat, a shark). Use **no article** for plurals (people, waves, fish) or uncountable nouns (water).

**📖 Essential Vocabulary from the Video**
*   **Wildlife:** a rhinoceros (a rhino), a shark, fish, a whale
*   **Landscapes:** a beach, waves, mountains
*   **Activities & Transport:** surfing, scuba-diving, skiing, a zip-line, a hot-air balloon, a helicopter, a plane, a boat, horses
*   **People:** people surfing, people diving

**⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid**
*   Don't forget the **"a"** for singular nouns: "I saw boat" ❌ -> "I saw **a** boat" ✅
*   **People** is already plural! You don't say "peoples".
*   For activities, say **"people surfing"** (not "people surf").
